# 8-Puzzle (with A* algorithm on Unity)
My bachelor project at university; which is a visual 8 puzzle on Unity with the ability to auto-solve using A* algorithm

## Overview
8-Puzzle is one of the classic problems at modeling algorithms, invented by Palmer Chapman at 1874. 
Players may move the boxes next to the blank house to reach the goal state which is the sorted form of boxes from 1 to 8.
